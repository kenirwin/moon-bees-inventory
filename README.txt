* choose transfer type: 
    * bulk to bulk
    * bulk to package
    * bulk to product (this will have multiple inputs and one output)
* item lookup
    * auto lookup probable matches? 
    * maybe search by keyword (e.g. elderberries), then pick a "from" and a "to" product

* bulk to bulk:
    * look up kitchen/from quantity
    * look up retail quantity
    * user enters amount to xfr
    * calculate the projected new levels
    * confirm xfr
    * assign new amounts in inventory API

* bulk to package:
    * basically the same, but a bit more work to calculate amount

* bulk to product:
    * add input products to "cart" in amounts
    * add output product in amounts (tins of booboogoo, grab bags, etc.)
